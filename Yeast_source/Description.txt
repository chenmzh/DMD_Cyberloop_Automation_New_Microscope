open loop with DMD test 
1 Sample. 40x (oil) objective = 40 = 60 magnification
We also waited for 20(before experiment) + 20 + 20 (shutter off) mins before running the experiment. 

- we set exposure to 2s
- taking images every 2mins
- simple off-on patterns several times
- fixed bug in code (temporarely) for DMD (manual external pattern)
- We use the gray 50/255 pattern

Second run in the afternoon 15:17 -- turn off DMD, run it again, no initial delay. 
Third run at 5:24 (20min on off pattern, to se re-activation/recovery of the cells)
